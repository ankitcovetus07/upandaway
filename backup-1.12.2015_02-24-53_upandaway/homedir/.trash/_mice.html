<h1>MICE</h1>
<p>MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) is a type of tourism, in which large groups, usually planned well in advance, are brought together for a particular purpose. The MICE Industry is also called the Meetings Industry.
</p>
<p>
The MICE industry has been growing over the past few decades into a mature business sector, driven by the globalisation and due to the increase in cross border trade. Businesses simply cannot function in a fully effective way without the face-to-face meetings of the parties involved. More and more companies now understand that meetings, conferences and exhibitions are indispensable means of communicating their business messages, increasing sales and business development in Brazil, Russia, India and China. As a result, the MICE industry in Brazil, Russia, India, China and the USA has been growing at a phenomenal rate. Trade shows and exhibitions are very popular and people flock for such events. We are privileged to have a network that can be most helpful in facilitating your MICE events.
</p>
<h1>Meetings:</h1>
<p>Meetings planning services are provided by our meetings and events professionals. This network serves as an excellent resource while planning meetings of all types and sizes. Whether you are responsible for planning a multi-city nationwide series of medical dinner meetings, a single corporate board meeting, a gala event, or anything in between, we can help plan and arrange for the all the meeting logistics according to your requirements.</p>
<h1>Incentives:</h1>
<p>Unique and exclusive travel continues to be one of our most desired and sought after experiences and the generator of many of our most vivid memories. Top companies are capitalising on exclusive travel to reward and build key relationships, to create compelling promotions and to inspire higher performance. Firms are finding that travel not only motivates and rejuvenates but it also creates long term positive association with the company. In short, incentive travel continues to be proven as an effective contributor to bottom line results. We are best situated to help you plan for these unique and memorable experiences.</p>
<h1>Some of the most effective uses of Incentive Travel:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Engages key value-added resellers</li>
<li>Builds relationships with key clients</li>
<li>Rewards top performers and president circle level employees</li>
<li>Incentives for sales promotes dealer / distributor networks</li>
<li>Corporate hospitality to retain and reward large clients</li>
<li>Corporate hospitality to acquire key accounts</li>
<li>Attracts highest level executives for round table discussions</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conferences:</h1>
<p>
Recognising that a successful program hinges on an effective design, Up and Away Travel will work with you to develop innovative outreach initiatives that go beyond traditional conference programs and seminars. Our staff can help you to develop an integrated and unique program appropriate to the issues, the audience, the setting, and your discipline to meet all of your needs. Through our relationships and network throughout the world, we can also assist in bringing relevant government and trade organisations to participate in your conferences.
</p>
<h1>Exhibitions:</h1>
<p>
Exhibitions work because they are face-to-face. They provide us an opportunity to accelerate the selling cycle by matching needs with a company's ability to meet those needs. They work because adults are visual learners. Exhibiting is a like a portable company with a visual medium – the exhibit, products, the graphics, collateral materials and promotional products are visual elements. Buyers are also experiential. Trade shows are extremely effective to launch new products in the market.
</p>
<p>
The Meetings Industry consists of a broad range of organisers, suppliers and facilities engaged in the development and delivery of meetings, conferences, exhibitions and other related events which are held in order to achieve a range of professional, business, cultural or academic objectives.
</p>
<p>
The Meetings Industry is a distinct economic sector, with its own unique organisations, standards, priorities and communication vehicles. It is comprised largely of small to
medium sized organisations which are not as formally integrated as many other industries; however, it achieves a high degree of functional integration through extensive, ongoing exchanges amongst industry organisations. It has also had traditionally ongoing relationships with the tourism and hospitality sectors, which it supports by generating incremental demand for travel, accommodation and destination services and with which it often interacts in the processes of service delivery and destination promotion.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the Meetings Industry is a key component of the knowledge economy, acting as a vehicle for business, professional and academic communities to achieve the interactions required for the knowledge transfer, collaboration and information dissemination which is the primary purpose of these events. The industry recognises that to be sustainable it must achieve a greater level of recognition for the benefits it delivers in relation to global economic and professional development, specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing stimulus to global economic growth by creating forums for new product development, exchange and marketing;</li>
<li>Facilitating academic, technical and professional advancement by encouraging the global development and exchange of research, knowledge, standards and procedures;</li>
<li>
Supporting communities by facilitating access to global knowledge and expertise and attracting new investment potential;
</li>
<li>
Enhancing and supporting transportation, hospitality and tourism infrastructure by creating an economically important rationale for non-leisure travel;
</li>
<li>
Promoting international cooperation and collaboration by encouraging and sustaining business and professional networks, and
</li>
<li>
Supporting economic transition by facilitating retraining and professional development on a global basis.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Meetings Industry has long recognised the importance of sustainability and environmental concerns, and as a result has developed extensive procedures and guidelines to actively address these issues as they relate to its own activities. However, it also acknowledges and promotes the essential importance of
face to face interactions in developing and maintaining personal and organisational relations as well as the efficiencies achieved by addressing business and professional outcomes through group activities such as conventions and exhibitions rather than the individual travel that would otherwise be required.
