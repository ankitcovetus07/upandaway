        <p>What we do and how we do it is not what is important to us. WHY we do what we do is our greatest driving factor and it is the WHY that we as a team and business have fixed our eyes on. We want to be courageous and outrageous – to be educators, generous with our time and knowledge and to trust God for His provision.</p>
        <p>We want to educate – we want to lighten the load of our clients -  not for profits, churches, schools and individuals. We want to enable them to get on with the business of saving and transforming lives.</p>
