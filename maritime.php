        <p><strong>What is a negotiated marine or offshore fare? </strong></p>
		<p>
        Marine or offshore fares are specially negotiated airfares available only to appointed travel agencies designed to allow special rates and conditions to travellers who are employed in the marine industry. In most cases, the traveller must be travelling to or from a cruise ship, private yacht, commercial vessel, port, or offshore rig. Every airline imposes its own eligibility conditions for the use of these fares and some airlines permit travel by shore side staff employed in the shipping industry
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>We leverage our global purchasing power to negotiate deeply discounted business and economy air fare.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        By negotiating on our clients' behalf, organisations of all sizes benefit from the savings and flexibility of these fares. Mariners, oil and gas travellers, and corporate travellers in virtually any industry can benefit from our experience and expertise in securing negotiated contract airfares. Our negotiated fares are refundable, changeable, one-way or round-trip, and are available on a global scale.
As a market leading global travel management company, we have the combined size and global scale to offer all of our clients, big and small, significant negotiated savings.

        <strong>Travel Services for Maritime Employees:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Getting our travellers to the right vessels, at the right time, is a demanding and constantly changing operation. Up and Away Travel specializes in the travel needs of the marine service industry and has the knowledge and unmatched ability to meet the travel challenges this sector faces on a daily basis. Up and Away Travel understands the requirements, the complexities, and the last minute changes that occur. We have firsthand experience in dealing with the challenges that this type of business brings; how to quickly move employees to and from tough to reach locations, dealing with the challenges that crews present, coordinating the logistics and providing a comprehensive stable service in any situation.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are an authorized distributor for maritime airfares on over 90 airlines worldwide – giving you access to millions of fares – to every airport with scheduled IATA service. We hold these fares, access them electronically from our appropriate service offices, and keep them constantly updated. This ensures that we can quote immediately for the route requested, as we do not have to wait for the airline to respond to an inquiry. Many of our special fares often have the baggage charges waived to allow flexibility for your maritime workers.
No matter how complex your maritime travel needs may be, we will help you simplify the process.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Travel Services for Energy sector</strong></p>
        <p>
        <strong>The majority of our global corporate client base is in the energy sector.</strong> We provide exclusive airfare discounts to qualified travellers in the Energy Industry. These unique fares are offered to offshore, onshore, exploration, subsea, drilling, oilfield and maritime workers. Sub-contractors providing ancillary services and alternative energy work related travellers also qualify.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a client, you can take advantage of our wholly-owned specialty contracts immediately, regardless of size. These heavily discounted airfares offer savings up to 75 percent off published fares, plus offer flexibility and enhanced luggage allowance.
Our experience with these types of clients gives us the unique benefit of managing unforeseen challenges arising in this industry. Travel to energy destinations can be quite challenging. Travel managers must trust us travel both in terms of customer care and safety to address travel which is complex, subject to constant change and potentially labour intensive. We thoroughly understand these needs and only offer experienced travel staff that can immediately assist regular travel requests, as well as any emergency travel need that may arise during transit.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Travel Services for Offshore Workers</strong></p>
        <p>
        Due to high global demand and rapid growth of the international Oil and Gas sector, Up and Away Travel have proactively negotiated thousands of airfares specifically for the offshore worker. These fares offer flexibility, similar to marine airfares.
Transporting crews to these difficult destinations requires a travel management company that is capable in creating complex and accurate international itineraries. Our experienced staff is fully versed on international fare construction, visa requirements and above all, global geography. We offer cost effective solutions to your offshore travel needs because we understand the importance of transporting crew on time and within budget.
By being an authorised distributor of our own contracts, we are able to control the entire travel reservation process. From inventory extraction to pricing and ticketing, our processes are streamlined and offer even greater savings. Our operational knowledge is strongly built around the specific challenges these bookings can encounter, and our counselors are well versed in dealing with them.
Companies in the offshore industry trust their travel plans and business travellers to us because we bring the insight and expertise of international travel management professionals to them. As the demand of offshore drilling increases, Up and Away Travel is ready to assist you.
